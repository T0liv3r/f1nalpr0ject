# Preproposal## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?I was thinking of choosing between the website route or the mobile app route. For a website, I would go with developing something that can actually be useful while still maintaining a level of light-heartedness to it. After hearing about the project that gave users restaurant recommendations based on the food they chose from their favorite television show, I decided doing something along those lines would be pretty cool. Something else that gives me ideas are the impossible quiz games and the boredbutton.com website. An app where once you go onto another app that uses a camera feature and you pull up that camera feature, it sets off a certain type of notification that comes up as an affirmation. For example, when people put sticky notes on their mirrors to remind them to love themselves. It’ll be like that but virtual. I also think doing something with the Raspberry Pi would be cool. I would have to do a bit more research on project ideas to incorporate the device but I am still open to potentially using it in my final project. Overall, I haven’t fully decided what I plan on doing but these two ideas or something similar is what I am leading towards the most. ## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?I don’t plan on collaborating with other classmates. ## Do you have any questions of your own?How finished do we have to be by the deadline? For example, if I were to submit a project where I do have code and a good idea but I couldn’t get past all the errors by the deadline so it simply doesn’t run how many points would be taken off? This question also goes for if I was able to get through all possible errors and my code “runs” but nothing actually shows for it and it isn’t playable or usable. Thank you!
